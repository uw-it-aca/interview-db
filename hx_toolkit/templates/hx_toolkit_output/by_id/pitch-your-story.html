            <p>Introducing yourself in social or professional settings can often set up connections for the future. Whether you are attending a formal job fair or mingling at an event, you want to capture a person’s attention and make an impression in a few minutes.</p>

<p>An effective way to connect and to convey your message is a personal elevator pitch. This is a clear, concise, and specific statement that describes you, your interests, and your strengths in less than 30 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Say something about yourself, what you care about, and what you like doing.</li> 

<li>Try creating a few sentences about who you are, what you're seeking, and what you can offer.</li>

<li>Prepare and practice your pitch so it flows naturally. Practice alone and with friends so that you feel comfortable introducing yourself to new people.</li> 

<li>Tweak your pitch often to keep it current and to adapt it to each situation you are in.</li>

<li>Be prepared for the next step; describing your experience, skills and the contributions you hope to make.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally your “elevator pitch” will leave someone wanting to know more about you and lead to a longer conversation or additional connections.</p>
